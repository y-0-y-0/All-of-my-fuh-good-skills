# Roblox Input

## When to Load

Load for keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch, motion, or cross-platform action binding. Client-side only. For simulation-affecting input in a Server Authority project, use the Input Action System rather than traditional input events.

## Quick Reference

**Core events** (`UserInputService`): `InputBegan`, `InputChanged`, `InputEnded` fire as `(input: InputObject, gameProcessedEvent: boolean)`. `InputBegan` does NOT fire for mouse wheel. Events only fire while the client window is focused.

**Prefer `ContextActionService` over `InputBegan`** for gameplay: free conflict resolution (chat won't steal H) and free mobile buttons:

```luau
local CAS = game:GetService("ContextActionService")

local function onAction(name, state, _input)
    if name == "Jump" and state == Enum.UserInputState.Begin then
        humanoid.Jump = true
    end
end

CAS:BindAction("Jump", onAction, true,
    Enum.KeyCode.Space, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA)
```

`BindAction(name, handler, createTouchButton, ...inputTypes)`. Handler returns `ContextActionResult.Sink` to consume, `.Pass` to fall through.

**Server Authority:** use `InputAction`/`InputContext` for inputs that affect the core simulation, store the input state where the synchronized simulation can read it, and process it through `RunService:BindToSimulation()` (requires `Workspace.UseFixedSimulation` enabled in Studio). `ContextActionService` remains appropriate for UI-only or classic-project actions.

**Gamepad UI focus:** separate gameplay bindings from menu selection. Set `GuiService.SelectedObject`, mark controls `Selectable`, and test nested/modal navigation.

**Gamepad:** use `GetConnectedGamepads()` and listen to connection changes.

**Touch:** use high-level gesture events or raw `TouchStarted`/`TouchMoved`/`TouchEnded` when tracking fingers.

**Dragging:** `DragDetector` (3D parts/models, physics-capable) and `UIDragDetector` (UI) make objects draggable with zero code; events `DragStart`/`DragContinue`/`DragEnd`.

**Pitfalls**:
- `gameProcessedEvent=true` in InputBegan → UI consumed it. Filter for gameplay.
- `BindAction` is stack-based: most-recent wins. Use `BindActionAtPriority`.
- Client-only. Server scripts silently no-op.
- `JumpRequest` fires multiple times per jump; debounce.
- Mouse wheel only fires `InputChanged`.
