# Luau Core Language

## When to Load

Load for pure Luau syntax and semantics: truthiness, tables, iteration, functions, scope, operators, string patterns, and JS/Python ports. Routing: types → `roblox-luau-types`; ownership/lifecycle → `roblox-luau-patterns`; Roblox APIs → domain skills.

## Quick Reference

- Only `false` and `nil` are falsy. `0`, `""`, and `{}` are truthy.
- Equality does not coerce types. `0 == "0"` is false. Inequality is `~=`.
- Array conventions are 1-based. `#array` is meaningful only for a sequence without nil gaps.
- Assigning `nil` removes a table key; assigning a table copies the reference; `table.clone` is shallow.
- Dictionary iteration order is unspecified. Do not make behavior depend on it.
- Dynamic keys require brackets: `record[field]`. Dot syntax uses a literal identifier.
- Missing arguments become `nil`; extra results and arguments can be discarded.
- Prefer an `if` expression over `condition and a or b` when `a` may be falsy.
- Local names are scoped from their declaration onward. Forward-declare mutually recursive functions.
- Luau string patterns are not regular expressions. Their syntax and capabilities differ.
- Backtick interpolation and `..` concatenation are both valid. Choose the clearer form; join many fragments once in a hot loop.
- NaN does not equal itself and defeats `<`/`>`; test with `x ~= x`.
- Binary data uses the `buffer` library: fixed size, 0-based offsets, explicit-width reads/writes. Avoid `buffer.readinteger`/`writeinteger` (stubs, not released runtime).
- For Base64, hashing, or compression use `EncodingService` (buffers, not strings; JSON via `HttpService`). Details: see full reference.

```luau
local label = if enabled then "On" else "Off"
local message = `{name}: {score}`

local byId: {[number]: string} = {}
byId[userId] = name

for index, value in values do
    print(index, value)
end
```

### Translation traps

- JavaScript `===`, `!==`, `null`, optional chaining, spread, arrow functions, and array methods are not Luau syntax.
- Python `None`, zero-based list assumptions, list comprehensions, exceptions, and implicit tuple behavior do not translate directly.
- `x or fallback` tests truthiness, not only absence. It replaces a valid `false` value.
- `typeof(value)` recognizes Roblox datatypes; `type(value)` reports the underlying Luau type category.

### Review

Valid Luau, no nil gaps, no assumed dictionary order, no accidental aliases, no cross-language syntax, no fallbacks hiding `false` or `nil`.
