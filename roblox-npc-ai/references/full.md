## PathfindingService

### CreatePath Parameters

```luau
local PathfindingService = game:GetService("PathfindingService")

local path = PathfindingService:CreatePath({
    AgentRadius = 2,       -- half-width of the NPC (default 2)
    AgentHeight = 5,       -- height of the NPC (default 5)
    AgentCanJump = true,   -- can the agent jump over gaps?
    AgentCanClimb = true,  -- can the agent climb TrussParts?
    WaypointSpacing = 4,   -- studs between waypoints (default 4)
    Costs = {              -- material/region traversal costs
        Water = 20,        -- avoid water (20x more expensive)
        CrackedLava = math.huge, -- never traverse lava
    },
})
```

All materials have a default cost of 1. Set `math.huge` to make a material completely non-traversable.

### Computing and Following a Path

From the official Roblox pathfinding docs:

```luau
local PathfindingService = game:GetService("PathfindingService")

local path = PathfindingService:CreatePath({
    AgentCanClimb = true,
    Costs = { Water = 20 },
})

local character = script.Parent
local humanoid = character:WaitForChild("Humanoid")

local function followPath(destination: Vector3)
    path:ComputeAsync(humanoid.RootPart.Position, destination)

    if path.Status ~= Enum.PathStatus.Success then
        warn("Path failed:", path.Status)
        return false
    end

    local waypoints = path:GetWaypoints()

    -- Mark the traversal stale. Let the caller retry with a bounded policy.
    local blocked = false
    local blockedConnection = path.Blocked:Connect(function()
        blocked = true
    end)

    local completed = true
    for _, waypoint in waypoints do
        if blocked then
            completed = false
            break
        end

        if waypoint.Action == Enum.PathWaypointAction.Jump then
            humanoid.Jump = true
        elseif waypoint.Action == Enum.PathWaypointAction.Custom then
            -- Custom action (e.g. open door, use ladder)
            -- Handle based on waypoint.Label
        end

        humanoid:MoveTo(waypoint.Position)
        local reached = humanoid.MoveToFinished:Wait()

        if blocked or not reached then
            completed = false
            break
        end
    end

    blockedConnection:Disconnect()
    return completed
end
```

If this returns `false`, the caller should recompute from the NPC's current position with a bounded retry or cancellation policy. Do not recursively call `followPath` from `Path.Blocked`; a persistently blocked route can otherwise create overlapping traversals and unbounded work.

### Pathfinding Modifiers

Control how the pathfinder treats specific regions:

**Material costs**: make certain terrain materials expensive:
```luau
local path = PathfindingService:CreatePath({
    Costs = {
        Water = 20,         -- 20x more expensive than default
        CrackedLava = 100,  -- nearly impassable
        Slate = 20,         -- avoid slate areas
    },
})
```

**Region modifiers**: mark arbitrary zones as costly or impassable:
1. Create an Anchored, CanCollide=false Part around the region
2. Add a `PathfindingModifier` child with a `Label` (e.g. "DangerZone")
3. Reference the label in Costs:

```luau
local path = PathfindingService:CreatePath({
    Costs = {
        DangerZone = math.huge, -- completely avoid this region
    },
})
```

**PassThrough**: pathfind through solid obstacles (e.g. doors):
1. Create an Anchored, CanCollide=false Part around the door
2. Add a `PathfindingModifier` with `PassThrough = true`
3. The path will route through the door as if it's open

**PathfindingLink**: connect disconnected navmesh areas:
Use `PathfindingLink` to tell the pathfinder about custom traversal (teleporters, ziplines, boats). Set a Label and handle it in the waypoint loop via `waypoint.Action == Enum.PathWaypointAction.Custom`.

### Navigation Mesh

The navigation mesh is auto-generated from geometry. Debug it in Studio:
- View → Visualization Options → Navigation Mesh (shows walkable areas)
- View → Visualization Options → Pathfinding Modifiers (shows labels)

Colored areas = walkable. Small arrows = jump connections. Uncolored = impassable.

### Custom navmesh alternatives to PathfindingService

PathfindingService auto-generates its navmesh from geometry server-side. It is robust but black-box: no control over walkable geometry or generation. For full control, community modules port real navmesh generators to Luau (see the Navcast thread as a lead, https://devforum.roblox.com/t/navcast-an-attempt-to-port-recast-to-luau/4743538). Such ports are not game-ready: voxelization is far too slow for live or changing maps, so tile generation with yields between chunks is required. Use them as a reference point when PathfindingService's constraints don't fit your geometry or agent needs, not as a drop-in replacement.

## Pathfinding performance and improved search

Roblox has shipped an improved pathfinding search algorithm behind the Studio-only, non-scriptable `Workspace.PathfindingUseImprovedSearch` setting. Test it against representative maps and NPC agent parameters before enabling it in a live place. A path that succeeds is not automatically a cheap path.

Keep path requests bounded and event-driven:

- do not compute every NPC path every frame;
- stagger requests across frames and cache a path until the target or world meaningfully changes;
- avoid unnecessarily long searches and choose a destination budget appropriate for the map;
- avoid continuously moving `CanCollide` geometry when it is not needed, because navigation-mesh regeneration can become the bottleneck;
- capture a MicroProfiler trace when pathfinding slows down instead of assuming the state machine is at fault.

If `Path.Blocked` fires, recompute from the NPC's current position with a bounded retry policy. Do not allow a blocked-path callback to recursively create unlimited overlapping `ComputeAsync` calls.

## State Machine Pattern

The most reliable NPC AI architecture. Each NPC has a current state and transitions based on conditions.

```luau
--!strict
type State = "idle" | "patrol" | "chase" | "attack" | "flee" | "dead"

type NPCConfig = {
    detectionRange: number,
    attackRange: number,
    fleeHealthPercent: number,
    patrolPoints: {Vector3},
    attackCooldown: number,
    walkSpeed: number,
    runSpeed: number,
    fovDegrees: number,
    hearingEnabled: boolean,
    hearingRange: number,
}

type NPCState = {
    current: State,
    target: Player?,
    patrolIndex: number,
    lastAttackTime: number,
    humanoid: Humanoid,
    rootPart: BasePart,
    config: NPCConfig,
}

local function transition(npc: NPCState, newState: State)
    -- Exit current state
    if npc.current == "chase" or npc.current == "patrol" then
        npc.humanoid.WalkSpeed = npc.config.walkSpeed
    end

    -- Enter new state
    npc.current = newState

    if newState == "chase" then
        npc.humanoid.WalkSpeed = npc.config.runSpeed
    elseif newState == "idle" then
        npc.target = nil
    end
end
```

### State Transitions

```
idle → patrol (has patrol points)
idle → chase (player detected)
patrol → chase (player detected)
chase → attack (in attack range)
chase → idle (target lost/died)
chase → flee (health low)
attack → chase (target moved out of range)
attack → flee (health low)
flee → idle (safe distance reached)
any → dead (health <= 0)
```

## Detection

### Distance Check (cheapest, do first)

```luau
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function findNearestPlayer(position: Vector3, range: number): Player?
    local nearest: Player? = nil
    local nearestDist = range

    for _, player in Players:GetPlayers() do
        local char = player.Character
        if not char then continue end
        local root = char:FindFirstChild("HumanoidRootPart")
        if not root then continue end
        local humanoid = char:FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid")
        if not humanoid or humanoid.Health <= 0 then continue end

        local dist = (root.Position - position).Magnitude
        if dist < nearestDist then
            nearest = player
            nearestDist = dist
        end
    end

    return nearest
end
```

### Line of Sight (raycast)

Only check LOS after distance check passes (raycasts are expensive):

```luau
local function hasLineOfSight(from: Vector3, to: Vector3, ignore: {Instance}, target: Instance?): boolean
    local direction = to - from
    local params = RaycastParams.new()
    params.FilterDescendantsInstances = ignore
    params.FilterType = Enum.RaycastFilterType.Exclude

    local result = workspace:Raycast(from, direction, params)
    -- Nothing between the endpoints: sight is clear.
    if result == nil then return true end
    -- The segment can clip the target's own queryable parts (aiming at the
    -- head grazes a hat or hand). A hit inside the target means the ray
    -- REACHED it: that is sight, not an obstruction. Only a hit on some
    -- other instance (a wall) blocks.
    if target and result.Instance:IsDescendantOf(target) then
        return true
    end
    return false
end

-- Usage: check if NPC can see player. Exclude the NPC's own character but
-- NOT the target's: pass the target as the last argument instead.
local canSee = hasLineOfSight(
    npc.rootPart.Position + Vector3.new(0, 2, 0), -- eye height
    targetRoot.Position + Vector3.new(0, 2, 0),   -- target eye height
    {npc.rootPart.Parent},                        -- ignore the NPC itself
    targetRoot.Parent                             -- hits within the target are visibility
)
```

### Field of View (cone check)

```luau
local function isInFOV(npcCFrame: CFrame, targetPos: Vector3, fovDegrees: number): boolean
    local toTarget = (targetPos - npcCFrame.Position).Unit
    local forward = npcCFrame.LookVector
    local dot = forward:Dot(toTarget)
    local angle = math.acos(math.clamp(dot, -1, 1))
    return angle <= math.rad(fovDegrees / 2)
end
```

### Combined Detection (distance → FOV → LOS)

```luau
local function canDetectPlayer(npc: NPCState, player: Player): boolean
    local char = player.Character
    if not char then return false end
    local root = char:FindFirstChild("HumanoidRootPart")
    if not root then return false end

    -- 1. Distance (cheapest check first)
    local dist = (root.Position - npc.rootPart.Position).Magnitude
    if dist > npc.config.detectionRange then return false end

    -- 2. Field of view (medium cost)
    if not isInFOV(npc.rootPart.CFrame, root.Position, npc.config.fovDegrees) then
        if not npc.config.hearingEnabled or dist > npc.config.hearingRange then
            return false
        end
    end

    -- 3. Line of sight (expensive, do last); pass the target so hits on
    -- the player's own parts read as visibility, not obstruction
    return hasLineOfSight(
        npc.rootPart.Position + Vector3.new(0, 2, 0),
        root.Position + Vector3.new(0, 2, 0),
        {npc.rootPart.Parent},
        root.Parent
    )
end
```

## Spawn Systems

### Basic Spawner with Cap

```luau
local MAX_ENEMIES = 10
local SPAWN_INTERVAL = 5
local activeEnemies: {Model} = {}

local function spawnEnemy(spawnPoint: BasePart): Model?
    if #activeEnemies >= MAX_ENEMIES then return nil end

    local enemy = ServerStorage.EnemyTemplate:Clone()
    enemy:PivotTo(spawnPoint.CFrame + Vector3.new(0, 3, 0))
    enemy.Parent = workspace.Enemies
    table.insert(activeEnemies, enemy)

    -- Track death
    local humanoid = enemy:FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        humanoid.Died:Once(function()
            local idx = table.find(activeEnemies, enemy)
            if idx then table.remove(activeEnemies, idx) end
            task.delay(3, function() enemy:Destroy() end) -- cleanup after death anim
        end)
    end

    return enemy
end

-- Spawn loop
task.spawn(function()
    while true do
        task.wait(SPAWN_INTERVAL)
        local spawnPoints = workspace.SpawnPoints:GetChildren()
        local point = spawnPoints[math.random(1, #spawnPoints)]
        spawnEnemy(point)
    end
end)
```

### Wave System

```luau
type WaveConfig = {
    enemies: {{template: string, count: number}},
    spawnDelay: number, -- seconds between individual spawns
    waveDelay: number,  -- seconds between waves
}

local waves: {WaveConfig} = {
    {enemies = {{template = "Zombie", count = 5}}, spawnDelay = 1, waveDelay = 10},
    {enemies = {{template = "Zombie", count = 8}, {template = "FastZombie", count = 3}}, spawnDelay = 0.8, waveDelay = 15},
}

local function spawnWave(wave: WaveConfig, spawnPoints: {BasePart})
    for _, group in wave.enemies do
        for i = 1, group.count do
            local point = spawnPoints[math.random(1, #spawnPoints)]
            local template = ServerStorage.Enemies:FindFirstChild(group.template)
            if template then
                local enemy = template:Clone()
                enemy:PivotTo(point.CFrame + Vector3.new(0, 3, 0))
                enemy.Parent = workspace.Enemies
            end
            task.wait(wave.spawnDelay)
        end
    end
end
```

## Network Ownership and Server Authority

For classic replication, decide deliberately whether an unanchored NPC assembly should be server-owned. Server ownership can prevent client-owned physics from producing unexpected motion, but it is not a complete anti-exploit boundary and it costs server simulation work.

```luau
local function setServerOwned(model: Model)
    for _, part in model:GetDescendants() do
        if part:IsA("BasePart") then
            part:SetNetworkOwner(nil)
        end
    end
end

setServerOwned(enemy)
```

In a Server Authority project, configure `Workspace.AuthorityMode = Server` and its required replication, fixed-simulation, streaming, and input settings. Server-owned gameplay physics can remain responsive through client prediction, so `SetNetworkOwner(nil)` is not the authority model and the classic secure-but-laggy trade-off does not apply in the same way.

Measure CPU, pathfinding, and replication cost at the intended NPC count. If visual motion becomes too coarse in a classic project, replicate authoritative state and interpolate on the client instead of handing gameplay authority to the client.

## Update Loop

Don't run AI logic every frame. Use a configured interval based on the behavior's responsiveness and profile it under the intended NPC count:

```luau
local AI_TICK_RATE = 1/10 -- example only; tune and measure for the project
local accumulated = 0

RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(dt)
    accumulated += dt
    if accumulated < AI_TICK_RATE then return end
    accumulated -= AI_TICK_RATE

    for _, npc in activeNPCs do
        updateNPC(npc)
    end
end)
```

For large NPC counts, keep a rotating work cursor or queue so not all NPCs think on the same frame. Make the per-tick budget a measured project setting.

## Common Mistakes

- **Client-side NPC logic**: ALL NPC behavior must run on the server. Client only handles animations/visuals.
- **No path blocked handling**: Paths go stale when the world changes. Always connect `path.Blocked` and recompute with bounded retries.
- **ComputeAsync with no fallback**: If path computation fails (`Status ~= Success`), don't freeze. Fall back to direct movement or idle.
- **Tight detection loops**: Don't check every NPC against every player every frame. Distance checks are O(n*m); throttle and batch based on profiler evidence.
- **Treating network ownership as security**: In classic projects, choose ownership deliberately. In Server Authority projects, configure the authority model; `SetNetworkOwner(nil)` alone is not the security boundary.
- **Not cleaning up dead NPCs**: Destroy models after death animation. Corpses accumulate and kill performance.
- **MoveTo timeout**: `Humanoid:MoveTo()` has an 8-second timeout. If the NPC gets stuck, `MoveToFinished` fires with `reached = false`. Handle it.
- **Pathfinding on the client**: PathfindingService works on both client and server, but NPC movement must be server-authoritative. Compute paths on the server.
- **No stagger for large NPC counts**: A large batch of path requests on one frame can spike the server. Stagger updates and measure the actual budget.

## Avatar appearance: HumanoidDescription, BodyColors, Shirt, Pants

### HumanoidDescription: the canonical runtime appearance API

- Change an NPC's appearance at runtime with `Humanoid:ApplyDescription(description)`; read current appearance with `Humanoid:GetDescription()`. ApplyDescription batch-applies every field in one step; prefer it over piecemeal property edits.
- Clone-and-modify: never mutate a shared or template description in place. Clone it, edit the clone, apply. A shared instance mutates every NPC referencing it.
- Key fields: `Shirt` and `Pants` (classic clothing asset IDs), `Face`, body-part mesh IDs (`Head`, `Torso`, `LeftArm`, `RightArm`, `LeftLeg`, `RightLeg`), per-part `*Color` (Color3), and R15 scale fields: `HeadScale`, `HeightScale`, `WidthScale`, `DepthScale`, `BodyTypeScale`, `ProportionScale`.
- Accessories: per-bone string fields (`HatAccessory`, `HairAccessory`, `FaceAccessory`, `NeckAccessory`, `FrontAccessory`, `BackAccessory`, `WaistAccessory`, `ShouldersAccessory`) plus the Accessories table managed by `SetAccessories(accessories, includeRigidAccessories)` / `GetAccessories(includeRigidAccessories)`. Attach accessory instances with `Humanoid:AddAccessory(accessory)`.
- R6 vs R15: scale fields and body-part mesh IDs apply to R15 only; they are ignored on R6. Classic clothing (`Shirt`/`Pants` IDs) works on both. Batch-apply with ApplyDescription so the rig rebuilds once.
- Build descriptions from real avatars: `Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromUserIdAsync(userId)` and `Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromOutfitIdAsync(outfitId)`.

### BodyColors (legacy)

- Legacy instance parented to the character with one BrickColor per body part: `HeadColor`, `TorsoColor`, `LeftArmColor`, `RightArmColor`, `LeftLegColor`, `RightLegColor`.
- Superseded by `HumanoidDescription`'s `*Color` Color3 fields for most uses. Keep for R6-only or legacy rigs.

### Shirt / Pants

- Parent a `Shirt` or `Pants` instance to the character model; set `ShirtTemplate` / `PantsTemplate` to classic clothing content IDs (ContentId).
- Replace safely: `character:FindFirstChildOfClass("Shirt")`, create and parent a new instance if missing, then set the template.

```luau
-- Server: clone a template description, tweak, apply
local template = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("NPCAppearance", true):FindFirstChildOfClass("HumanoidDescription")
local desc = template:Clone() -- never mutate the shared template
desc.HeightScale = 1.1
desc.HeadScale = 1.15
desc.Shirt = 5832882895 -- classic shirt asset ID
npcHumanoid:ApplyDescription(desc)
```

## Legacy tools: HopperBin (deprecated)

`HopperBin` is the pre-2013 ancestor of `Tool`: drop it in `StarterPack` and the player auto-equips it. It is deprecated; do not use it for new work. Migrate to `Tool` (parent to `Backpack` / equip via `Humanoid:EquipTool`) or to a prompt-based interaction (`ProximityPrompt`) for non-held abilities. Do not wire `HopperBin`-era events (`Bin.Selected`/`Bin.Deselected` are the old API) into new systems; only tolerate HopperBins when preserving a legacy place file.
